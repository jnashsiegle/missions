              <h3>Need Content for this Section / Status Update</h3>
      <p>You really need to get me some content that tells the user who they are donating to.  Call it a legitimacy statement.  Nothing too verbose, but is a definite need.  About the missions department, what you do etc.  A testimony or two would also be of help.  </p>       
      <h3>And More Status Comments - Pictures </h3>
      <p>Put pictures into a lightbox.  When clicked it opens up full size into a lightbox gallery that can be closed individually or all the pictures can be seen fullsize </p>     
      <p>I still need to add ways to share, facebook, email, twitter, perhaps?</p>
